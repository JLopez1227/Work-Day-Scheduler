# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
In this assignment we were tasked with making the Work Day Scheduler starter code functional. We had to change up the HTML to have all the necessary time blocks needed for Present, Past, and Future. To get the application to work we had to used JavaScript and Days.js. I had to store HTML elements in consts variables then uses JavaScript to make those HTML functional. For example, getting the time blocks to change color based on their class, required using JavaScript to access those elements then used if statement to apply the classes once blockTime was past the currentTime. The application already came styled from the starter code.
